# 🌟 Social Media App — Frontend (API Playground)

## 🟣 Project Description

This **Social Media App** is a **frontend application** designed as **an API playground**.  
The main purpose of this project was **to practice API integration with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  
It allowed me to:

- Implement **authentication (login & register)**.
- Display **posts with pagination and infinite scroll**.
- **Create new posts** by adding title, body, and photo.
- Display **profile information** for the authenticated user.

🚀 **This is not the final version of the project.**  
It’s a temporary environment I created to connect with a **REST API** and practice the fundamentals of **API requests**, **authentication**, and **CRUD operations** on a **simple UI**.

## 🟣 Future Plans

- The final version will be **more sophisticated**, featuring:
  - **A large number of posts and richer content.**
  - **Cleaner and more interactive UI/UX.**
  - Possible migration from vanilla JavaScript to **React**.
  - Better pagination, state management, and routing.
  - Additional functionality (like comments, likes, follow/unfollow, etc.).

## 🟣 Tech Stack

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **API Communication:** Axios
- **Framework:** Bootstrap 5 for UI components
- **Design:** Responsive UI, pagination, toast messages
- **Auth:** JWT authentication (Bearer Token)
